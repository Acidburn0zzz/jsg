[test.js](test.js) runs the normal tests.
[make test](Makefile) runs test.js tests as well as a set of positive tests against documents in these repositories:
  * [SPARQL.js](https://github.com/RubenVerborgh/SPARQL.js)
  * [ShEx.js](https://github.com/shexSpec/shex.js)
  
For the moment, SPARQL.js is expected to be a sybling of jsg while the shex.js directory is expected to appear in ../shexSpec/ .
